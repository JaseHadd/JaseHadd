- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaseHadd
- 👀 I’m interested in writing tools that simplify/automate everyday tasks, and sometimes ones that solve puzzles
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever little things come up between what I know and what I'm trying to do
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing in particular, but let me know if you have ideas!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at jasehaddleton@outlook.com.au
